# Taskmaster-Pro
A Kanban board to help you manager your tasks. 

## Description

This project's goal was to create a planner with dynamic events using by jQuery, as well as incorporating Moment (or an application like Moment) into the code. The application should show working hours on the left and have a space to write in upcoming/current/past events in the middle of the screen. The color of the working hours should change based on whether they are in the future, the current hour, or in the past. The events should be stored in local storage on the browser and stay on the applicaton even when the browser is refreshed.

This project helped me further understand jQuery and bootstrap as well as reviewing and relearning concepts in vanilla javascript.
