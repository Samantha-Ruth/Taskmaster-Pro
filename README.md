## Description

This project's goal was to create a multiple-choice quiz using javascript, specifically focusing on event-listeners and local storage.  The quiz is timed and should progress from one question to the next. Every time the use clicks on a wrong answer, the timer decreasing by 10 seconds. When the quiz ends (which is when either the user makes it to the end of the questions or the timer runs out), the user is given their score and the opportunity to enter their initials into a high-score list. This list should be saved in the local storage and accessible from a button on the website.

This project helped introduce me to javascript event selectors, creating dynamic elements with new attributes, storing and retrieving items from local storage, and continuing with html structuring and css styling.  I did not finish as much as I wanted, having a little bit of trouble with the event selectors on dynamically created elements.  I hope to further my understanding of these items in the future.
