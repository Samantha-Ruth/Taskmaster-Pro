# Taskmaster-Pro
A Kanban board to help you manager your tasks. 

## Description

This project's goal was to create a planner with dynamic events using by jQuery, as well as incorporating Moment (or an application like Moment) into the code. The application allows for a user to enter tasks and label them as "to do", "in progress", "in review", "done".  The user can also designated a due date of each item. If the item is due to be finished within the next two days, the box will be colored in orange.  If the task needs to be deleted,the user can grab it and drag it to the bottom of the screen to remove it from the page. The taks stored in local storage on the browser and stay on the applicaton even when the browser is refreshed.

This project helped me further understand jQuery and bootstrap, as well as moment and the "click and drag" components of jquery.
